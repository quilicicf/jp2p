[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/quilicicf/jp2p/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/quilicicf/jp2p)

A utility method to get the line & column to which a JSON pointer points in a given JSON string.

More information about JSON pointers [in the RFC6901](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-09);

## How to use

The module only contains one method, use it like this:

```js
var jp2p = require('jp2p');
var jsonString = '{\n  "toto": "tata"\n}';

console.log(jp2p.getLineNumber(jsonString, '/toto'));
```

In this case it will output `{ line: 2, column: 10 }`. The line in the jsonString at which the element at JSON pointer `/toto` is defined.
